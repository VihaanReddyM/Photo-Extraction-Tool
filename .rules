# Photo Extraction Tool - Project Rules
# =====================================
# These rules define coding standards, architecture decisions, and best practices
# for maintaining and extending this project.

## Consistency Guidelines
## ----------------------

### Project Scope & Device Support
- **Primary focus**: iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch)
- **Secondary support**: Other MTP-compatible devices (Android phones, cameras, etc.) via `apple_only = false`
- The tool uses Windows Portable Devices (WPD) API which supports any MTP device
- Always emphasize iOS as the primary use case, but acknowledge broader MTP support exists

### Terminology Standards
- Use "iOS devices (iPhone/iPad)" when describing the tool's main purpose
- Use "Apple devices" when referring to the `apple_only` filter option
- Use "MTP-compatible devices" when referring to the broader category (Android, cameras, etc.)
- Use "Windows Portable Devices (WPD) API" when discussing the underlying technology
- NEVER say "any phone" - use "iOS devices" or "MTP-compatible devices" as appropriate
- NEVER use "iOS device" and "Apple device" interchangeably in the same context

### Driver & Software Requirements
- **No iTunes required**: The tool works without iTunes installation
- **No additional drivers needed**: Windows 10/11 includes built-in MTP/USB drivers
- When troubleshooting device access issues, mention:
  1. Device must be unlocked
  2. User must tap "Trust This Computer" on the device
  3. Try a different USB cable or port
- Do NOT mention "iTunes/Apple Mobile Device Support" in error messages - this is misleading

### Platform Support
- This is a **Windows-only** tool (requires WPD API)
- Config file location examples may show Linux/macOS paths for completeness, but always note Windows is the only supported platform
- Future cross-platform support is not guaranteed

### Documentation Consistency
- README.md is the primary source of truth for user-facing information
- All help text, error messages, and doc comments should align with README terminology
- When updating any user-facing text, ensure it matches the terminology standards above

## Code Style & Formatting
## -----------------------

### Rust Edition
- Use Rust 2021 edition
- Target stable Rust (no nightly features)

### Formatting
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Group imports: std, external crates, internal modules

### Naming Conventions
- Types: PascalCase (e.g., `DeviceManager`, `ExtractionConfig`)
- Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `extract_photos`, `get_device_info`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`)
- Modules: snake_case (e.g., `device_monitor`, `generic_extractor`)
- Traits: PascalCase with `Trait` suffix for abstraction traits (e.g., `DeviceContentTrait`)

### Documentation
- All public items MUST have doc comments (`///`)
- Module-level docs (`//!`) required for all modules
- Include examples in doc comments for complex APIs
- Use `# Example` sections in doc comments

## Architecture Rules
## ------------------

### Module Organization
- `core/` - Core business logic (extraction, config, tracking)
- `device/` - Device interaction (WPD API, traits, profiles)
- `duplicate/` - Duplicate detection
- `cli/` - Command-line interface only
- `ui/` - UI support (events, controllers, monitors)
- `testdb/` - Testing infrastructure (mock devices, scenarios)

### Trait-Based Abstraction
- Device operations MUST go through traits (`DeviceContentTrait`, `DeviceManagerTrait`)
- This enables testing without real devices
- Never use WPD types directly in core extraction logic

### Threading Model
- UI components MUST use channel-based communication
- Use `mpsc` channels for event passing
- Use atomic types for shared state (not mutexes in hot paths)
- All `Trait` bounds should include `Send + Sync` for thread safety

### Error Handling
- Use `thiserror` for error type definitions
- Use `anyhow` for error propagation in binaries
- Custom `Result<T>` type alias in each module
- Errors should be descriptive and actionable for users

## Testing Rules
## -------------

### Test Coverage
- All public APIs must have unit tests
- Integration tests for cross-module functionality
- Use `testdb` module for device-related testing

### Test Organization
- Unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` modules within source files
- Integration tests in `tests/` directory
- Test scenarios defined in `testdb/scenarios.rs`

### Mock Devices
- Use `MockDeviceManager` and `MockFileSystem` for testing
- Never require a real device for automated tests
- Test both success and failure paths

### Memory Considerations
- Tests must not allocate excessive memory
- Use lazy content generation for large test files
- Run tests with `cargo test` - they should complete without crashes

## Dependencies
## ------------

### Dependency Policy
- Prefer well-maintained, widely-used crates
- Minimize dependency count where reasonable
- Pin versions in Cargo.toml for reproducibility

### Required Dependencies
- `windows` - Windows API bindings (WPD)
- `clap` - CLI argument parsing
- `serde` + `serde_json` + `toml` - Serialization
- `sha2` - Hashing for duplicate detection
- `thiserror` + `anyhow` - Error handling
- `log` + `env_logger` - Logging
- `chrono` - Date/time handling
- `rayon` - Parallel processing

### Optional Dependencies
- `image` - Only if thumbnail generation is needed
- Keep image processing optional to reduce binary size

## Performance Rules
## -----------------

### Memory Efficiency
- Use streaming for large file operations
- Avoid loading entire files into memory when possible
- Use size pre-filtering before expensive hash operations
- Cache results where appropriate (e.g., duplicate index)

### Concurrency
- Use `rayon` for parallel file scanning
- Keep UI responsive with background threads
- Use atomic operations for progress tracking

### File I/O
- Buffer file reads/writes (64KB default buffer)
- Use `BufReader`/`BufWriter` for file operations
- Avoid unnecessary file system calls

## Platform Rules
## ---------------

### Windows-Specific
- This is a Windows-only tool (WPD API requirement)
- Use Windows path conventions
- Handle Unicode file names correctly
- Set file attributes (e.g., hidden for tracking files)

### COM Handling
- Always initialize COM before WPD operations
- Use RAII for COM guard (`ComGuard`)
- Clean up COM resources properly

## Configuration Rules
## -------------------

### Config File Format
- Use TOML for configuration files
- Provide sensible defaults for all settings
- Document all config options in `config.example.toml`

### Config Location
- Use platform-appropriate config directories
- Support both user config and project-local config

## Git & Version Control
## ---------------------

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits format
- Prefix: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore
- Keep subject line under 72 characters

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - stable, release-ready code
- Feature branches for new development
- PR required for main branch

### What to Commit
- Source code and tests
- Documentation
- Configuration examples
- DO NOT commit: target/, *.exe, cache files, personal configs

## Security Rules
## ---------------

### API Keys & Secrets
- Never hardcode secrets
- Use environment variables or secure config
- Document required secrets without exposing them

### File Handling
- Validate file paths before operations
- Prevent path traversal attacks
- Handle symbolic links carefully

## UI Module Specific Rules
## ------------------------

### Event System
- All background operations emit events
- Events must be `Clone` and `Send`
- Use structured event types, not strings

### Controller Pattern
- Controllers manage background operations
- State must be queryable without blocking
- Support cancellation at any point

### Device Monitoring
- Polling-based (no native Windows notifications used)
- Configurable poll intervals
- Graceful handling of device disconnection

## Backward Compatibility
## ----------------------

### API Stability
- Public API changes require version bump
- Deprecate before removing
- Document breaking changes

### Config Compatibility
- New config options must have defaults
- Support reading older config versions
- Migration path for breaking config changes

### Cache/State Files
- Version cache file formats
- Handle corrupted/outdated files gracefully
- Provide rebuild mechanisms

## Documentation Requirements
## --------------------------

### README.md
- Project overview and features
- Installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Configuration guide
- Must use consistent terminology (see Consistency Guidelines above)
- Primary device focus: iOS devices (iPhone/iPad)
- Secondary: mention MTP support for other devices where appropriate

### Code Documentation
- Module-level docs explaining purpose
- Function docs with parameters and return values
- Complex algorithms need inline comments

### Architecture Docs
- Keep `docs/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md` updated
- Document major design decisions
- Include diagrams where helpful
