## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration is stored in a standard location that persists across updates:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\photo_extraction_tool\config.toml` |
| **Linux/macOS** | `~/.config/photo_extraction_tool/config.toml` |

### Quick Setup

The easiest way to configure the tool:

```bash
# Open config in your default text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
photo-extraction-tool config
```

This will:
1. Create the config directory if it doesn't exist
2. Create a default config file with all options documented
3. Open it in your default editor for `.toml` files

After editing, just save the file - changes apply on the next run.

### Alternative: Local Config Override

You can also place a `config.toml` in your current directory to override the global config. This is useful for project-specific settings. The search order is:

1. `./config.toml` (current directory)
2. `./photo_extraction.toml` (current directory)
3. Standard config location (see table above)

### Configuration Sections

<details>
<summary><b>📁 Output Settings</b></summary>

```toml
[output]
# Where to save extracted photos
directory = "./extracted_photos"

# Keep original folder structure (e.g., DCIM/100APPLE/)
preserve_structure = true

# Skip files that already exist
skip_existing = true

# Organize into YYYY/MM folders by date
organize_by_date = false

# Create subfolder named after device
subfolder_by_device = false
```

# Only detect Apple devices
apple_only = true

# Filter by device name (partial match)
# device_name_filter = "iPhone 15"

# Specific device ID
# device_id = "\\?\usb#vid_05ac..."
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 Extraction Settings</b></summary>

```toml
[extraction]
# Only extract from DCIM (Camera Roll)

# File type filters
include_photos = true
include_videos = true

# Extension filters (empty = all)
include_extensions = []  # e.g., ["jpg", "heic"]

```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Duplicate Detection</b></summary>

```toml

# Folders to compare against
comparison_folders = ["D:/Photos", "D:/Old Backups"]

# Algorithm: "perceptual", "exif", or "size"
hash_algorithm = "perceptual"

# Similarity threshold (0 = exact, 5 = similar)
similarity_threshold = 5

# Cache hashes for faster subsequent runs
cache_index = true
cache_file = "./photo_hash_cache.bin"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👥 Device Profiles</b></summary>

```toml

# Base folder for all device backups
backup_base_folder = "D:/Photos"

# Profile database

```

</details>

## 🔧 Features in Detail

### Incremental Backups

The tool tracks which files have been extracted, so subsequent runs only copy new photos:

```bash
# First run: extracts all photos
photo-extraction-tool -o "D:/Backup"

# Later runs: only extracts new photos
photo-extraction-tool -o "D:/Backup"
```

### Duplicate Detection

Avoid extracting photos you already have elsewhere:

```toml
[duplicate_detection]
enabled = true
comparison_folders = [
    "D:/Photos/Main Library",
    "D:/Backups/Old iPhone"
]
hash_algorithm = "perceptual"
similarity_threshold = 5
```

The perceptual hash algorithm detects duplicates even if they've been resized or re-encoded.

### Multi-Device Management

Organize photos from multiple devices automatically:

```toml
[device_profiles]
enabled = true
backup_base_folder = "D:/Photos"
```

Result:
```
D:/Photos/
├── Johns_iPhone_15_Pro/
│   └── DCIM/...
├── Marys_iPad_Air/
│   └── DCIM/...
└── Kids_iPhone_SE/
    └── DCIM/...
```

### Managing Your Configuration

```bash
# Open config in your default editor
photo-extraction-tool config

# View current settings
photo-extraction-tool show-config

# See where the config file is stored
photo-extraction-tool config --path

# Start fresh with default settings
photo-extraction-tool config --reset
```

### Date-Based Organization

Organize photos by when they were taken:

```toml
[output]
organize_by_date = true
```

Result:
```
extracted_photos/
├── 2024/
│   ├── 01/
│   │   ├── IMG_0001.jpg
│   │   └── IMG_0002.heic
│   ├── 02/
│   └── 03/
└── 2023/
    └── 12/
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Device Not Detected

1. **Trust the Computer**: When you connect your iPhone, tap "Trust" on the device
2. **Unlock Your Device**: The device must be unlocked for access
3. **Check USB Connection**: Try a different cable or USB port
4. **Restart the Device**: Sometimes a restart helps

### Slow Extraction

- HEIC and large video files take longer to transfer
- USB 2.0 ports are slower than USB 3.0
- Consider using `--dry-run` first to see file counts

### Permission Errors

- Run the tool as Administrator if you encounter permission issues
- Check that the output directory is writable

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No devices found" | Connect device, unlock it, and trust the computer |
| "Access denied" | Unlock device or run as Administrator |
| "Path not found" | Check output directory exists |
| "Config file not found" | Run `photo_extraction_tool config` to create one |
